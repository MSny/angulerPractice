# AngularJS


What is angular?

Simple definition: A client-side javascript framework for adding interactivity to HTML...

...HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it is lacking when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. 

As angular.js is a front-end framework so all you need to know is javascriptâ€¦ which is lucky given we are all javascript connoisseurs!

Why angular?
Angular:
- helps organise JS
- helps create responsive (i.e. fast) websites
- is easy to test as it encapsulates your code into different sections
